# This file contains the login information for your bot.

# This information is not required, however if you have registered a bot 
# with Wikipedia, I highly recommend you use it. It will allow more results
# per query and will speed up the runtime when fetching page information

# See the following link for more information
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots

@username  = "ChrisSalij Bot" # The username of your registered bot.
@password   = "odcsss"        # The password for your registered bot

# This is the user agent string you provide when connecting to wikipedia.
# There is no need to change this, but if you understand what a user agent
# is, feel free to modify it.
@useragent = "ChrisSalij_Bot Contact:Chris@Salij.org"
# If you are having trouble with this. Please comment the following line, and
# replace "your@email.com", with your contact email**.

# @user_agent = "Autobot - Contact Your@email.com"



# ** This is in the case that there is something wrong with the bot, so that
#    Wikipedia can contact you to fix the problem, rather than block you
