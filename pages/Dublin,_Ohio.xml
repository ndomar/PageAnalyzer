'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also several other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city, as well as the Nicklaus-designed Country Club at Muirfield. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

==Parks and Recreation==
[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also several other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city, as well as the Nicklaus-designed Country Club at Muirfield. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]]. hp rulz

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also several other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city, as well as the Nicklaus-designed Country Club at Muirfield. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

==Parks and Recreation==
[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also three other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also three other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

==Parks and Recreation==
[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Parks and Recreation==
[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also three other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

'''Dublin''' is a city in [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin]], [[Delaware County, Ohio|Delaware]], and [[Union County, Ohio|Union]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]]. The population was 31,392 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]]. In 2008, the population was estimated to be 38,536&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2008-04-39.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places in Ohio, Listed Alphabetically: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |format= |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Dublin continues to be one of the fastest-growing suburbs of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Approximately 57,000 people live within the Dublin school district.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Each year in late May or early June, the city hosts the [[Memorial Tournament]], a stop on [[golf]]'s [[PGA Tour]]. Consequently, a large number of golf aficionados choose to make Dublin their home. There are also three other golf courses in Dublin. The Riviera Golf Club is home to the American-Italian Golf Association. Tartan Fields Golf Club, which hosted the [[LPGA]]'s [[Wendy's Championship for Children]] from 1999 through 2006, is also in Dublin. Dublin also has a public golf course financed by the city. 

Other annual events include the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] music event, a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade, and the [[Dublin Irish Festival]].

==History==
Although its earliest settlements date back to 1802, the village that came to be known as Dublin didn't begin to take shape until the arrival of the Sells family of [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]]. Brothers Peter and Benjamin Sells purchased 400 acres (1.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land on the west banks of the [[Scioto River]] as a gift for their brother John. In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810 he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace of [[Dublin, Ireland]].

&quot;If I have the honor conferred upon me to name your village, with the brightness of the morn, and the beaming of the sun on the hills and dales surrounding this beautiful valley, it would give me great pleasure to name your new town after my birthplace, Dublin, Ireland.&quot;

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as [[Ashland Inc]] and [[Wendy's|Wendy's International]]. In addition, the growth of the [[Muirfield Village]] Golf Club and its residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] attracted a large number of affluent citizens to the rapidly growing [[suburb]]. Dublin was officially declared a [[city]] in 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents.

As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of both [[Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Washington Township]] and [[Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio|Perry Township]].

==Geography==
Dublin is located at {{coord|40|6|33|N|83|8|25|W|city}} (40.109262, -83.140247).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.8&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 21.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (54.7&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.04&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.1&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (0.09%) is water.

The [[Scioto River]] passes through Dublin.  In this area the river and its tributaries cut deep gorges through the limestone bedrock, and the riverbed is stony.  Some of these tributaries feature waterfalls.

===Topography===
Located on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], Dublin has relatively flat topography. Nevertheless, there are numerous ravines surrounding the tributaries of the Scioto River, which make for steep cliffs in some areas. Elevations range from 780 feet (238 m) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] where the Scioto River leaves the city at Hayden Run Road, while the high point is 1000 feet (305 m) at Glacier Ridge Metro Park.&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Northwest Columbus (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map, Shawnee Hills (OH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
[[Image:SR161inDublin.JPG|thumb|right|State Route 161 crossing the Scioto River]]
Being a modern American suburb, the city is primarily accessed by car. In addition to Interstate 270, [[U.S. Highway 33]], [[Ohio State Route 161|State Route 161]], and [[Ohio State Route 745|State Route 745]] pass through the city. There is a 77 mile (124&amp;nbsp;km) network of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike trails]] that run throughout the city. Long term plans include expanding the trails further, as well as connecting them to the regional trail system to facilitate travel to downtown Columbus. [[Central Ohio Transit Authority|COTA]] provides limited service in the southeast part of the city. Routes 56 and 58 provide express service from the commercial areas around Frantz and Rings Roads to [[Downtown Columbus]] during rush hour periods.

==Economy==
Dublin is home to the headquarters of a number of companies, including [[Wendy's]], [[Cardinal Health]], [[Ashland Inc.]], [[IGS Energy]], [[OCLC]], and [[Mindleaders|MindLeaders]]. Other organizations with significant operations include [[Nationwide Insurance]], [[Verizon Business]], [[Verizon Wireless]], and Tickets Galore. The city is attempting to attract new technology oriented businesses as well. Dublin Methodist Hospital, part of the OhioHealth system, opened in January 2008. The city is in the process of creating a city wide internet (mesh wifi) hotspot; being developed by [[DHB Networks]].

[[Image:DublinRecCenter.JPG|thumb|right|Dublin Community Recreation Center]]
Dublin features {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} of parks, including {{convert|77|mi|km}} of scenic bike trails and 39 developed parks with wooded natural areas and river frontage. Several Dublin parks are located along the Scioto River, including the two Dublin Kiwanis Riverway parks.  The river is accessible at several points for small watercraft, and the nearby Griggs and [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy]] reservoirs allow motorboating and sailing.

Several of Dublin's parks are home to a unique assortment of outdoor sculptures—part of the Art in Public Places collection, established by the Dublin Arts Council. In 1989, the Council developed the program to enhance the quality of life for residents, and to establish a public art tour throughout the City to attract visitors. It has since become a nationally recognized program. The series includes a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall stone portrait of local legend, &quot;Leatherlips&quot; (the Wyandot Native American Chief known for the strength of his word); Field of Corn—featuring 109 human-sized cement ears of corn that seem to sprout from one Dublin field; and a copper house that honors the region's native American culture.

Ballantrae Park is located at the entrance of its namesake subdivision. Sitting upon a 20-foot-tall hillock, there is a {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} bronze sculpture called “Dancing Hares”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
